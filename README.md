## Startup and Test
I opened the project in Intellij then run the Swagger2SpringBoot
Then open up the swagger UI at http://localhost:5003/ep85/spot-hero/1.0.0/swagger-ui.html#/
I also provided a postman collection in the main directory "spothero.postman_collection.json"

# Swagger generated server
Spring Boot Server 

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:500/  

Change default port value in application.properties
